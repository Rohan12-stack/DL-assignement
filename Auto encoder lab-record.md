1.	Data Preparation:
o	The code utilizes TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets to train and assess a basic autoencoder on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.
o	A preprocessing function (map_image) is used to normalize and flatten each image, followed by shuffling and batching the dataset for training and testing purposes.
2.	Autoencoder Architecture:
o	The key part of the code involves defining the autoencoder's structure through a function (simple_autoencoder) that constructs the encoder and decoder using dense layers (specific details to be added by the user).
o	The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, using binary cross-entropy as the loss function, and is trained for 50 epochs using the MNIST dataset.
3.	Model Visualization:
o	After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated by predicting encoded and decoded images from a test batch. These are displayed side-by-side with the original images using Matplotlib.
o	Separate models for the encoder and autoencoder are created to visualize the learned representations and outputs.
o	Ten random images from the test dataset are selected, and their encoded and decoded versions are compared to assess how well the model has learned.
